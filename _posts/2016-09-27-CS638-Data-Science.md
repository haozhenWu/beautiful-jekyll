#####Backgroud
I am taking Computer Science 638 - Data Science from University of Wisconsin Madison this semester. I will share the course information here including the course project we did. [Course Website](https://sites.google.com/site/anhaidgroup/courses/cs-638-fall-2016)

####Project
The project is about crawling data from websites, extracting useful features, joining data from different sources, and finally building some machine learning models. We primarily use python. The project is being divided into several stages.

* Stage 0: Form a team. Due Tue Sept 20
* Stage 1: Crawl and extract to obtain two tables, three weeks, due Tue Oct 11



####Detail
#####Stage 1
We decided to use scrapy and beautiful soup from Python as our primary packages to first collect the data we need. We are interested in movie related websites such as IMDB and Yahoo movive. More detail progress will come soon here.
